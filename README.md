## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to problems from LeetCode, a popular platform for coding interviews and competitive programming. Each solution is implemented in C++ and is organized by the problem's name or ID for easy navigation.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
leetcode-solutions/
├── README.md
├── arrays/
│   ├── two_sum.cpp
│   └── ...
├── linked_lists/
│   ├── reverse_linked_list.cpp
│   └── ...
├── trees/
│   ├── binary_tree_inorder_traversal.cpp
│   └── ...
├── dynamic_programming/
│   ├── longest_increasing_subsequence.cpp
│   └── ...
└── ... (other categories as needed)
```

- Each directory contains solutions related to a specific topic or data structure.
- Each file is named according to the problem it solves, with a brief description in the comments.

## How to Use

To use or test any of the solutions:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ilorde-exe/leetcode.git
   cd leetcode
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory of interest:
   ```sh
   cd arrays
   ```

3. Compile and run the C++ file:
   ```sh
   g++ two_sum.cpp -o two_sum
   ./two_sum
   ```

Feel free to modify the code or use it as a reference for your own solutions.
